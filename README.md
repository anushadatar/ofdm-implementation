# OFDM Implementation

*Mark Goldwater and Anusha Datar*

Olin College SP21 Principles of Wireless Communications Lab 3.
# Summary
This repository contains code and documentation associated with
decoding signals sent and received in an OFDM system.

The main function for the first part of the lab, which does not
require timing syncrhonization, is [simulate_with_synchronized_clocks.m](https://github.com/anushadatar/ofdm-implementation/blob/main/simulate_with_synchronized_clocks.m). 
The [release](https://github.com/anushadatar/ofdm-implementation/releases/tag/v.3.a) for this section of the lab provides a stable version
of this software.

The main function for the second part of the lab, which does
require timing syncrhonization, is [simulate_without_synchronized_clocks.m](https://github.com/anushadatar/ofdm-implementation/blob/main/simulate_without_synchronized_clocks.m). 

Our [final report](https://github.com/anushadatar/ofdm-implementation/blob/main/docs/report.pdf) 
includes more details about our implementation 
and additional theoretical background.
